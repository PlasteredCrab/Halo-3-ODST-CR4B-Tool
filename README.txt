This will be added onto later....

For now to get this to work:

-----Install------

1: Open new Blend file
2: File > Append > Halo_3_Categories.blend > NodeTree > (Select everything in here, check the box for Fake Users, and click Append)
3: Go to the Scripting Tab in Blender at the top right and open up the CR4B Tool script
4: Save this file as a new .blend file so you don't have to do Step 2 each time
5: Download Halo 3 Editing Kit on Steam (You need to buy Halo: MCC and comes with all the Tag data from the games that you will need)
6: Open up the .python file for CR4B Tool and change the directories for TAG_ROOT and EXPORT_ROOT

TAG_ROOT: the root directory of the "tags" folder of the Halo 3/ODST Editing Kit
EXPORT_ROOT: the directory to where you are exporting your models and textures from Reclaimer

7: move the "shaders" folder to your EXPORT_ROOT folder (this is to make sure the tool has all default textures to use)
