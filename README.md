# Halo-3-ODST-CR4B-Tool
Completely Ready 4 Blender (CR4B Tool)

This tool is called Completely Ready 4 Blender and aims to do most of the work needed to port levels and objects from Halo 3, ODST, and Reach to Blender.
It accesses the raw tag files in binary and pulls the correct values, colors, scaling info, as well as various texture information needed by said object and tries it's best to setup the Shader nodes for you as well.

Tool is currently in Open Beta and is ready for public testing on Halo 3 and ODST objects and levels. Reach support coming later as Shader Nodes need to be made.

Special thanks to Chiefster and Soulburnin for the help making the Shader Nodes used by this tool to make the objects and levels to be as accurate as they can be!
Without their help, this tool would not have gotten as far as it did so fast :)
